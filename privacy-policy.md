# Privacy Policy â€“ BabySteps

BabySteps is provided by Ken Lam as a **free** app with no premium or paid content required to access functionality.

This document outlines our policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for users of the app.

## Information Collection and Use

BabySteps is designed with privacy in mind. The app processes and stores your baby's feeding data locally on your device using Core Data. This includes:

- Baby names and birth dates
- Milk feeding records (quantities in ml from 10-400ml, feeding types - breast milk or formula, precise dates and times)
- Daily feeding aggregations and statistics
- Interactive charts and visualizations
- User preferences (default milk quantities, last used quantities per baby, app themes, quantity management settings)
- Undo/redo history (up to 10 recent actions for data recovery)

**We do not collect, store, or share any of this personal information on our servers.** All data is stored locally on your device and, if enabled, synced through your personal iCloud account using CloudKit.

## CloudKit

BabySteps uses Apple's CloudKit service to enable family sharing features and real-time synchronization. When you use these features:

- Data is stored in your personal iCloud account, not on our servers
- Sharing is controlled entirely by you through the app's sharing interface
- We have no access to your shared data or family members' information
- CloudKit operates under Apple's privacy policies and security standards

## Service Providers

We may engage third-party providers to:

- Support or operate parts of the service
- Perform service-related tasks
- Analyze how the app is used

These providers are only allowed to access information necessary to perform their tasks and are bound by confidentiality agreements.

## Security

We are committed to protecting your information. While we use commercially acceptable methods to safeguard it, no system can guarantee absolute security. Your data is protected by:

- Local device encryption
- Apple's CloudKit security measures (when sharing is enabled)
- Secure data transmission protocols

## External Links

BabySteps includes links to external sites, including:
- App Store for app reviews and ratings
- GitHub repository for accessing current policy documents
- Policy and terms documents hosted on GitHub

We do not control and are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party websites. When you access external links, you are subject to the privacy policies and terms of those services.

## Children's Privacy

BabySteps is designed for parents and caregivers to track infant feeding data. While the app may contain information about babies and children, we do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal data, we will promptly delete it. If you're a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please contact us.

## Data Retention and Deletion

- All data is stored locally on your device using Core Data
- User preferences are stored locally using UserDefaults
- You can delete individual feeding records or entire baby profiles at any time through the app interface
- When you delete the app, all local data is permanently removed from your device
- CloudKit data follows Apple's data retention policies and remains in your iCloud account until you manually delete it
- You can export your data or remove shared access at any time through the app's sharing controls

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page, and users are encouraged to review it periodically.
